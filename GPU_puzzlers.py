# GPU architectures are critical to machine learning, and seem to be
# becoming even more important every day. However, you can be an expert
# in machine learning without ever touching GPU code. It is hard to gain
# intuition working through abstractions. 

# This notebook is an attempt to teach beginner GPU programming in a
# completely interactive fashion. Instead of providing text with
# concepts, it throws you right into coding and building GPU
# kernels. The exercises use NUMBA which directly maps Python
# code to CUDA kernels. It looks like Python but is basically
# identical to writing low-level CUDA code. 
# In a few hours, I think you can go from basics to
# understanding the real algorithms that power 99% of deep learning
# today. If you do want to read the manual, it is here:

# [NUMBA CUDA Guide](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cuda/index.html)

# I recommend doing these in Colab, as it is easy to get started.  Be
# sure to make your own copy, turn on GPU mode in the settings (`Runtime / Change runtime type`, then set `Hardware accelerator` to `GPU`), and
# then get to coding.

# ## Puzzle 1: Map
#
# Implement a "kernel" (GPU function) that adds 10 to each position of vector `a`
# and stores it in vector `out`.  You have 1 thread per position.


# **Warning** This code looks like Python but it is really CUDA! You cannot use
# standard python tools like list comprehensions or ask for Numpy properties
# like shape or size (if you need the size, it is given as an argument).
# The puzzles only require doing simple operations, basically
# +, *, simple array indexing, for loops, and if statements.
# You are allowed to use local variables. 
# If you get an
# error it is probably because you did something fancy :). 


# *Tip: Think of the function `call` as being run 1 time for each thread.
# The only difference is that `cuda.threadIdx.x` changes each time.*

# You have fewer threads per block than the size of `a`.

# **Warning**: Each block can only have a *constant* amount of shared
#  memory that threads in that block can read and write to. This needs
#  to be a literal python constant not a variable. After writing to

# That is, each step of the algorithm should sum together half the remaining numbers.

#  a partial dot-product and iteratively move the part you
#  copied into shared memory.* You should be able to do the hard case
#  in 6 global reads.
